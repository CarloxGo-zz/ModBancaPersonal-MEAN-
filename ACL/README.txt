4. Save and upload all files from the archive to your webserver.

5. Using your browser, navigate to the install.php file wherever you uploaded it.
//NO hace falta ejecutar el install.php si has creado el schema y los datos en Mysql por tu cuenta

6. Select whether or not you want to install the sample records.

7. Once it finishes running the SQL commands to create the tables it will redirect you to the index page.

8. Delete install.php, install.sql, and sampleData.sql.

NOTE: If you change the ACL permissions so that user #1 no longer has the 'access_admin' 
permission, you won't be able to access the admin site because userID = 1 is hardcoded in /index.php.
Also, you must first go to /index.php before you go to any of the admin pages, as index.php 
sets the session variable assigning you userID #1.
